# 1️⃣.Ethereum Wallet & Smart Contract Interaction in Rust

This project demonstrates how to create an Ethereum wallet, check balances, send transactions, and 
interact with a smart contract using Rust and the `ethers-rs` and `web3` crates.

## 🚀 Features
- Generate a new Ethereum wallet with a private key.
- Check the wallet's balance.
- Send ETH from a sender wallet to a recipient.
- Interact with a smart contract to store and retrieve values.
- Fetch and display transaction receipts.

## 📦 Dependencies
Ensure you have Rust installed. You need the following Rust crates:

```toml
[dependencies]
ethers = "2.0"
web3 = "0.18"
dotenv = "0.15"
hex = "0.4"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## 🛠 Setup
Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/R0hit-Yadav/Web3_Rust_X_Blockchain.git
cd web3_eth_wallet
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following:

```ini
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL="https://holesky.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"
SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY="your_sender_wallet_private_key"
CONTRACT_ADDRESS="your_smart_contract_address"
```

## ▶️ Compile and Run

```sh
cargo run
```

## 📜 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Create a Wallet
- Generates a new Ethereum wallet.
- Displays the wallet address and private key.

### 2️⃣ Connect to an Ethereum Node
- Uses `ETHEREUM_RPC_URL` from `.env` to connect to an Ethereum provider.

### 3️⃣ Check Wallet Balance
- Fetches and prints the balance of the generated wallet.

### 4️⃣ Send an ETH Transaction
- Sends ETH from `SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY` to the generated wallet.
- Uses gas estimation to ensure enough balance is available.

### 5️⃣ Get Transaction Receipt
- Waits for transaction confirmation and displays receipt details.

### 6️⃣ Smart Contract Interaction
- Calls a contract function to store a value (`store(100)`).
- Retrieves the stored value from the contract.

## 🧠 What You Will Learn
- How to generate Ethereum wallets using `ethers-rs`.
- Connecting Rust to an Ethereum node using Web3 providers.
- Fetching account balances and handling gas estimation.
- Sending transactions programmatically with `ethers-rs`.
- Interacting with smart contracts via ABI encoding.

## 📌 Notes
- Always keep your private keys secure and never expose them in public repositories.
- Use a testnet (like infura) for development instead of mainnet to avoid spending real ETH.



# 2️⃣.Ethereum Wallet & Real-time Transaction Tracker in Rust

This project demonstrates how to interact with the Ethereum blockchain using Rust. It allows you to track transactions to a specific Ethereum address in real-time using WebSockets and the `web3` crate.

## 🚀 Features
- Connect to Ethereum via WebSockets.
- Monitor new blocks and fetch transactions.
- Track incoming transactions to a specific Ethereum address.
- Convert transaction values from Gwei to ETH.

## 📦 Dependencies
Ensure you have Rust installed. You need the following Rust crates:

```toml
[dependencies]
dotenv = "0.15.0"
ethers = "2.0.14"
futures = "0.3.31"
hex = "0.4.3"
serde = "1.0.217"
serde_json = "1.0.138"
tokio = {version = "1.43.0",features = ["full"]}
tokio-stream = "0.1.17"
web3 = "0.19.0"
```

## 🛠 Setup
Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/R0hit-Yadav/Web3_Rust_X_Blockchain.git
cd tx_tracker
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following:

```ini
ETHEREUM_WS_URL="wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"
```

## ▶️ Compile and Run

```sh
cargo run
```

## 📜 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Connect to an Ethereum Node
- Uses `ETHEREUM_WS_URL` from `.env` to establish a WebSocket connection.

### 2️⃣ Monitor New Blocks
- Subscribes to new block headers and retrieves block details.

### 3️⃣ Track Transactions to a Specific Address
- Iterates through transactions in each new block.
- Filters transactions matching `TARGET_ADDRESS.`
- Converts transaction values to ETH and logs the details.

## 🧠 What You Will Learn
- Connecting Rust to Ethereum via WebSockets.
- Subscribing to blockchain events in real-time.
- Fetching and filtering transactions using `web3`.
- Handling asynchronous operations with `tokio`.

## ⚡ Example Output
```yaml
Listening for transactions to: 0x3328F7f4A1D1C57c35df56bBf0c9dCAFCA309C49

Block Number: 18834567
Incoming Tx: 0xabc123...
   From: 0xdef456...
   Amount: 0.5 ETH
```

## 📌 Notes
- Always use a WebSocket provider like Infura for real-time updates.
- Keep your .env file secure and never expose API keys.
- Use testnets for development to avoid real ETH expenses.
